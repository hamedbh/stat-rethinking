# Intro {.unnumbered}

This is my attempt to work through the second edition of Statistical Rethinking, by Richard McElreath. It borrows a lot from Solomon Kurz's {tidyverse} and {brms}-centric take on the exercises, in that I use the tidyverse packages where possible. However I wanted to really get stuck into Stan directly, so I'm writing out my models by hand rather than using {brms}.
