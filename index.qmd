# Intro {.unnumbered}

This is my attempt to work through the second edition of [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), by Richard McElreath. It borrows a lot from Solomon Kurz's [{tidyverse}- and {brms}-centric take](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) on the book, in that I use the tidyverse packages where possible. However I wanted to really get stuck into Stan directly, so I'm writing out my models in Stan rather than using {brms}.
